This repo contains some openscad modules to print cases or shadow copies of some components or objects.

The measures are not that refined and in fact I usually leave more room because my printer is garbage and exact prints don't fit.\
(no, I don't rescale when I slice because I can't measure and different components need different levels of rescaling)

If a license can even apply to this thing, I don't really care what you use these files for.
